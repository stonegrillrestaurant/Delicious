      <div class="rule"><span>Prologue</span></div>

      <!-- Opening -->
      <p class="lead dropcap">
        Before there was light, there was silence. Before time began to flow, there was nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        But <em>“nothing”</em> was never truly empty — it was the stillness before motion, the unseen womb where everything waited to be born.
        It held no shape, no sound, no thought — yet within it slept the possibility of all things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Science calls it the quantum vacuum — a restless field where invisible sparks appear and vanish, whispering of creation even in the void.
        Philosophy calls it the absence of being — yet that absence is what allows being to emerge.
        And the soul recognizes it as that quiet moment after pain, before we find ourselves again.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="highlight">Nothingness is not death — it’s the pause between breaths, the space the universe needed to gather courage to begin.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is the silence that dares to speak, the emptiness that gives birth to form, the unseen stillness that taught existence how to move.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when you feel empty, remember — even the universe began as nothing. And look at it now.
      </p>

      <h2>In Science</h2>
      <p>
        When physicists say “nothing,” they often mean a vacuum — but that vacuum still has quantum energy, still allows particles to appear and disappear.
        So even “nothing” in science isn’t truly nothing. It’s something that behaves like nothing.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Even nothing is something — it has weight, it can create universes.” — attributed to Lawrence Krauss
      </blockquote>

      <h2>In Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Philosophers see “nothing” as the opposite of being — a state where not even awareness or potential exists.
        But that’s impossible to imagine, because the moment you think of nothing, you’re already turning it into something in your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        So “nothing,” in its purest form, might be something we cannot truly grasp, because to be aware of it is to already have something.
      </p>

      <h2>In Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        “Nothing” isn’t just emptiness — it’s the quiet possibility before creation, the pause before the first breath, the blank before the universe began to speak.
      </p>

      <!-- Physics/Philosophy/Reflection — concise reprise -->
      <div class="rule"><span>Contours of the Void</span></div>

      <h3>1. In Physics</h3>
      <p>
        Even in a vacuum — where no atoms or light exist — quantum fields remain. Tiny “virtual particles” constantly flicker in and out of existence.
        They borrow energy from the void, exist for a fraction of a second, then vanish again. That’s called <em>quantum fluctuations</em> — the restless heartbeat of nothingness.
      </p>
      <p class="aside">It’s like the universe never truly rests; even its silence hums.</p>

      <h3>2. In Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        “Nothingness” isn’t the absence of being — it’s the background that allows being to appear. Like how silence gives meaning to sound,
        or how the blank page gives shape to words. Without “nothing,” something could never exist — it needs space to be.
      </p>

      <h3>3. In Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        So yes — there is something in nothing. Not matter, but <em>potential</em>. Not sound, but the silence where sound can arise.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Nothingness is not the absence of being — it’s the unseen womb where everything begins.”
      </blockquote>

      <h3>In Physics</h3>
      <p>
        Even in a vacuum — where no atoms or light exist — quantum fields remain. Tiny “virtual particles” constantly flicker in and out of existence.
        They borrow energy from the void, exist for a fraction of a second, then vanish again. That’s <em>quantum fluctuations</em>.
      </p>
      <p class="aside">Even its silence hums.</p>

      <h3>In Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        “Nothingness” is the background that allows being to appear — as silence to sound, as page to word.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is something in nothing: potential, not matter; silence, not sound — but the place where sound can arise.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Nothingness is not the absence of being — it’s the unseen womb where everything begins.”
      </blockquote>

      <!-- Part II -->
      <div class="rule"><span>Part II</span></div>
      <h2>The Birth of Space</h2>
      <p>
        Out of the quiet breath of nothingness, space was born not as a thing, but as the room for things to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before creation, there was no “where.” Then, in an instant beyond time, nothing stretched itself open and became space —
        the soft canvas where light could travel, where matter could dance, where stories could unfold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Space did not appear inside something; it was the beginning of “inside” and “outside.” It gave the universe a place to grow,
        and it still expands, carrying us with it — a reminder that creation is not a one-time event, but a continuous unfolding of what once was “nothing.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Science calls it <em>spacetime</em> — a living fabric that bends and breathes with gravity, motion, and light.
        Philosophy calls it the <em>field of being</em> — the visible shape of invisible potential.
        And the soul calls it <em>home</em> — the vast silence that lets us exist at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what we call “emptiness” isn’t absence, but allowance. Space is the silence that welcomes sound, the stillness that lets things move,
        the openness that lets life be. Space is what nothing looks like when it learns how to hold everything.
      </p>

      <!-- Part III -->
      <div class="rule"><span>Part III</span></div>
      <h2>Nothing Becomes Space</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing and space are not opposites — they are partners. One gives birth to form, the other gives it a place to live.
        Nothing is the seed; space is the soil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without nothing, space would have no meaning. Without space, nothing would have nowhere to become something.
        They depend on each other like silence and sound, night and dawn, stillness and motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the cosmic dance, nothing becomes space, space becomes matter, matter becomes life, and life returns to stillness — back into nothing once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the rhythm of existence — a breathing universe, expanding and returning, forgetting and remembering itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand nothing is to understand creation. To understand space is to feel the breath of being. And between them lies the truth —
        that what we call everything is born in the quiet love between the unseen and the infinite.
      </p>
