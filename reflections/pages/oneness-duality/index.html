  <h1>Oneness & Duality</h1>
  <h2>The Reflection of the Eternal Balance</h2>

  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <p>All existence is born from the dance of opposites — light and shadow, silence and sound, motion and stillness.
  To see only one is to see half of truth; to embrace both is to awaken the whole. This reflection explores the paradox
  that Oneness and Duality are not enemies, but mirrors — each revealing the other’s face.</p>
  <blockquote>“The universe is not divided by its contrasts, but united through its rhythm.” — Ninox Antolihao</blockquote>
  <h3>The Mirror of Being</h3>
  <p>Within every atom lies both particle and wave — a symbol of the same unity that defines consciousness.
  Duality gives shape to experience, yet Oneness gives it meaning. Without the tension of contrast,
  awareness cannot know itself. Without separation, there can be no return to union.</p>
  <h4>Opposites as the Instruments of Creation</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Light cannot be seen without darkness.</li>
    <li>Joy has no meaning without sorrow.</li>
    <li>Faith is strengthened through doubt.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is in this interplay that the soul evolves — not by rejecting one side, but by harmonizing both.
  The divine balance is not found by escaping the world, but by recognizing the sacred pattern within it.</p>
  <h3>The Journey Through Contrast</h3>
  <p>Each moment of pain refines the essence of love; each confusion clarifies wisdom. Like the ebb and flow of tides,
  our emotions and experiences are not random, but cyclic expressions of an infinite intelligence unfolding through time.</p>
  <blockquote>“To master the self is not to silence the storm, but to become its calm center.”</blockquote>
  <div class="center">
    <p>Light and shadow share the same source.</p>
    <p>The flame exists because the night allows it.</p>
    <p>Within every breath — the rhythm of creation continues.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>The Reconciliation</h3>
  <p>When the seeker realizes that opposites are only two sides of the same truth, the illusion of separation dissolves.
  Heaven and Earth, mind and body, good and evil — all become instruments of the same cosmic symphony.
  The One manifests through the many, and the many return to the One.</p>
  <p>Thus, Oneness is not the absence of Duality, but its perfection.
  To live consciously is to see the divine in both extremes and to understand that love itself is the bridge between them.</p>
