      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

      <p>Once upon a time…<br>
      before churches…<br>
      before scriptures…<br>
      there were only stories.</p>

      <p>Stories whispered around fires.<br>
      Stories told not to prove anything…<br>
      but to help us understand<br>
      the quiet rhythm of existence.</p>

      <p>Back then, the story was a mirror.<br>
      But slowly… the mirror became a wall.<br>
      And what once guided the heart…<br>
      began to confine the mind.</p>

      <p>Religion didn't just interpret the mystery.<br>
      It declared its own interpretation<br>
      as absolute truth.</p>

      <p>Instead of saying,<br>
      "This is how we understand the mystery,"<br>
      it insisted,<br>
      "This is the mystery…<br>
      and there is no other way."</p>

      <p>That is not spirituality.<br>
      That is mythology mistaken for reality.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>FROM SYMBOLS… TO STORIES… TO DOGMA</h2>

      <p>Ancient teachings began as symbols--<br>
      gentle metaphors<br>
      for truths too vast to be spoken.</p>

      <p>But as centuries passed,<br>
      symbols hardened into stories…<br>
      and stories became rules.</p>

      <p>When a prophet said,<br>
      "This story is what happened,"<br>
      instead of,<br>
      "This story means something,"<br>
      the myth froze…<br>
      and humanity lost the metaphor.</p>

      <p>Creation may have been written<br>
      as a poetic description of cosmic order--<br>
      yet it was treated<br>
      as a literal event in time.</p>

      <p>And when myth is taken as fact…<br>
      our search for deeper meaning stops.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>WHY LITERAL TRUTH IS PROTECTED</h2>

      <p>Literal belief brings power.</p>

      <p>When a religion claims<br>
      that it alone holds the truth,<br>
      it gains influence<br>
      over morality…<br>
      over fear…<br>
      over hope.</p>

      <p>If people believe<br>
      their version of God is the only one,<br>
      then questioning becomes rebellion.<br>
      And obedience becomes salvation.</p>

      <p>At that point…<br>
      it is no longer faith.<br>
      It is authority…<br>
      disguised as certainty.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>METAPHOR: THE DOORWAY TO WISDOM</h2>

      <p>Myth, when understood symbolically,<br>
      is not false.<br>
      It is layered truth.</p>

      <p>Literalism shrinks it.<br>
      Metaphor expands it.</p>

      <p>The serpent in Eden<br>
      is not simply a creature--<br>
      it is temptation…<br>
      awakening…<br>
      transformation.</p>

      <p>The cross is not only wood--<br>
      it is the human struggle<br>
      between ego and surrender.</p>

      <p>The problem was never religion.<br>
      The problem was forgetting<br>
      how to read its language.</p>

      <p>We stopped reading poetry…<br>
      and began enforcing law.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>THE EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS</h2>

      <p>What you're sensing now<br>
      is what mystics have sensed<br>
      for thousands of years:</p>

      <p>Humanity rises when it stops<br>
      worshipping the symbol…<br>
      and begins understanding<br>
      the meaning behind it.</p>

      <p>Where God is not a being far away…<br>
      but the living pattern<br>
      woven into everything.</p>

      <p>We--this generation--<br>
      are learning to unfreeze the metaphor.<br>
      To read the divine story<br>
      as it was always meant to be read…</p>

      <p>Not as a map of the sky--<br>
      but as a mirror of consciousness.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>MAIN REFLECTION</h2>

      <p>Religion was never the enemy of truth.<br>
      Misunderstanding was.</p>

      <p>The earliest seekers<br>
      had no science…<br>
      no instruments…<br>
      only imagination.</p>

      <p>They painted meaning with myth--<br>
      transforming invisible truths<br>
      into living poetry.</p>

      <p>But when later generations<br>
      stopped seeing myth as symbol…<br>
      and started treating it as fact…<br>
      the poetry became a prison.</p>

      <p>A serpent of wisdom<br>
      was turned into an enemy.<br>
      A tree of knowledge<br>
      was turned into a threat.<br>
      A universe born of divine harmony<br>
      was reduced<br>
      to seven literal days.</p>

      <p>Literalism shrank the infinite.<br>
      Myth became dogma.<br>
      Faith became obedience.<br>
      Interpretation became institution.<br>
      And the living spirit of truth<br>
      was replaced by authority.</p>

      <p>The real tragedy<br>
      is not that religion exists--<br>
      but that it forgot<br>
      its original language.</p>

      <p>It began as music for the soul…<br>
      and ended as a list of rules.<br>
      It preached love…<br>
      but demanded conformity.<br>
      It offered symbols of awakening…<br>
      but punished those<br>
      who could see beyond them.</p>

      <p>Yet the sacred never disappears.<br>
      It simply waits--<br>
      quietly--<br>
      for someone willing<br>
      to translate again.</p>

      <p>The wise do not reject scripture.<br>
      They listen to it differently.</p>

      <p>They see God not as a figure--<br>
      but as the pulse<br>
      within all things.</p>

      <p>They see heaven not as a place--<br>
      but as a state<br>
      of clarity.</p>

      <p>They see sin not as punishment--<br>
      but as separation<br>
      from awareness.</p>

      <p>The lost language of metaphor<br>
      is the bridge<br>
      between faith and science…<br>
      between mystery and meaning…<br>
      between heart and reason.</p>

      <p>When we rediscover it…<br>
      the wall turns back into a window.<br>
      And through that window…<br>
      we find not religion…<br>
      but revelation.</p>
