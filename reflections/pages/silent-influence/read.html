    <article class="content">
      <p>There are mistakes we carry quietly, and there are wounds we never intend to cause — yet the ones that weigh the heaviest are those we plant in others without realizing it. Sometimes, our words, pride, or silence become the spark that leads another heart astray. We justify ourselves, saying we didn’t mean harm, but the truth is that goodness is not only about intention — it’s about influence.</p>

      <p>There are moments when we do something that may seem wrong in the eyes of others — an act that looks harsh or is misunderstood — yet in the end it opens their eyes and teaches a lesson that brings them closer to what is right. Those moments, though painful, serve a greater good.</p>

      <p>But the opposite is far worse: when our actions lead another soul away from truth. When what we say or do becomes the reason someone loses their light, that is not just a mistake — it is the deepest harm we can cause. Because sin that begins in one heart and spreads to another becomes a chain of pain that echoes far beyond our sight.</p>

      <p>True goodness, then, is not found in appearing righteous, but in living with awareness. To walk with love means to know that others may be walking behind us, learning from the path we take. Let our lives not be the reason someone falls — but the reason someone finds the courage to rise.</p>
