    <h2>THE LOST LANGUAGE OF METAPHOR</h2>
    <p><em>(by: Ninox Antolihao)</em></p>

    <p><strong>Title:</strong><br>
    The Lost Language of Metaphor</p>

    <div class="divider">⸻</div>

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <p>Once upon a time… long before churches… long before scriptures…<br>
    there were stories.</p>

    <p>Stories whispered around fires…<br>
    not to be owned, not to be proven…<br>
    but to reflect the divine rhythm of existence.</p>

    <p>Back then, the story was a mirror.<br>
    But somewhere along the way…<br>
    the mirror became a wall.<br>
    And the story… became law.<br>
    What was meant to awaken the soul…<br>
    began to bind it.</p>

    <p>Religion didn’t just interpret the mystery.<br>
    It canonized its own interpretation…<br>
    and declared it absolute truth.</p>

    <p>Instead of saying, “This is how we understand the mystery,”<br>
    religion said, “THIS is the mystery… and no other meaning exists.”</p>

    <p>That is not spirituality.<br>
    That is mythology… mistaken for reality.</p>

    <div class="divider">⸻</div>

    <h2>FROM SYMBOLS… TO STORIES… TO DOGMA</h2>

    <p>Ancient teachings began as symbols—<br>
    poetic attempts to describe truths too vast for human language.</p>

    <p>But over time, symbols hardened into stories…<br>
    and stories solidified into rules.</p>

    <p>When a priest or prophet declared,<br>
    “This story is what happened,”<br>
    rather than,<br>
    “This story means something,”<br>
    the myth turned literal—<br>
    and humanity lost the metaphor.</p>

    <p>The “creation story” may have been a poetic expression<br>
    of cosmic order…<br>
    yet it was treated as a historical event.</p>

    <p>And when myth is taken as fact…<br>
    the search for deeper meaning ends.</p>

    <div class="divider">⸻</div>

    <h2>WHY THEY CLING TO LITERAL TRUTH</h2>

    <p>Literal belief… creates control.</p>

    <p>When a religion claims monopoly over truth,<br>
    it gains authority over morality…<br>
    over fear…<br>
    over hope.</p>

    <p>When a group believes their version of God is the ONLY one,<br>
    questioning becomes rebellion.<br>
    Obedience becomes salvation.</p>

    <p>At that point… it isn’t faith.<br>
    It’s power—through certainty.</p>

    <div class="divider">⸻</div>

    <h2>METAPHOR: THE DOORWAY TO WISDOM</h2>

    <p>Myth, when understood symbolically, is NOT false.<br>
    It is multi-layered truth.</p>

    <p>Take it literally… and it shrinks.<br>
    See it metaphorically… and it expands.</p>

    <p>The snake in Eden isn’t just a reptile—<br>
    it’s temptation, knowledge, transformation.</p>

    <p>The cross isn’t just wood—<br>
    it’s the eternal struggle<br>
    between ego… and surrender.</p>

    <p>The problem was never religion itself.<br>
    The problem was forgetting how to read it.</p>

    <p>Humanity stopped reading poetry—<br>
    and began enforcing law.</p>

    <div class="divider">⸻</div>

    <h2>THE EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS</h2>

    <p>You are witnessing what mystics and philosophers saw long ago:</p>

    <p>Humanity evolves when it stops worshipping the symbol…<br>
    and begins understanding the meaning behind it.</p>

    <p>Where God is not a being “out there”…<br>
    but the very order, intelligence,<br>
    and living energy of existence itself.</p>

    <p>We—this generation—<br>
    are learning to unfreeze the metaphor…<br>
    to read the divine story as it was meant to be read:</p>

    <p>Not as a map of the sky…<br>
    but as a mirror of the mind.</p>

    <div class="divider">⸻</div>

    <h2>MAIN REFLECTION</h2>

    <p>Religion was never the enemy of truth—<br>
    misunderstanding was.</p>

    <p>The earliest seekers had no telescopes…<br>
    no equations…<br>
    only imagination.</p>

    <p>They painted meaning with myth,<br>
    turning invisible truths into living poetry.</p>

    <p>But when later generations<br>
    stopped seeing symbols as symbols,<br>
    and worshipped them as facts…<br>
    the myth became a prison.</p>

    <p>A serpent once symbolizing wisdom… became evil.<br>
    A tree symbolizing knowledge… became forbidden.<br>
    A universe born from divine order…<br>
    was reduced to seven literal days.</p>

    <p>Literalism shrunk the infinite.<br>
    Myth became dogma.<br>
    Faith became blind loyalty.<br>
    Interpretation became institution.<br>
    And the living spirit of truth<br>
    was replaced by the static claim of authority.</p>

    <p>The tragedy is not that religion exists…<br>
    but that it forgot its own language.</p>

    <p>It began as music for the soul…<br>
    and ended as a script of rules.<br>
    It preached love…<br>
    but demanded obedience.<br>
    It offered symbols of awakening…<br>
    but punished those who saw beyond them.</p>

    <p>But the sacred never dies.<br>
    It only hides—<br>
    waiting for a mind brave enough<br>
    to translate again.</p>

    <p>The wise do not reject scripture.<br>
    They RE-read it.</p>

    <p>They see God not as a figure…<br>
    but as the pattern in all things.</p>

    <p>They see heaven not as a place…<br>
    but as a state of clarity.</p>

    <p>They see sin not as punishment…<br>
    but as separation from awareness.</p>

    <p>The lost language of metaphor<br>
    is the bridge between faith and science…<br>
    between mystery and meaning…<br>
    between heart and reason.</p>

    <p>When we recover it…<br>
    the wall becomes a window again.<br>
    And through that window…<br>
    we rediscover not religion…<br>
    but revelation.</p>
